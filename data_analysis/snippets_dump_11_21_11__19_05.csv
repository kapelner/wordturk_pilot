But it<qu>s understood that Mr. Kravis is disappointed that Mr. Gillett did n<qu>t manage to boost SCI TV<qu>s operating profit after the buy-out. Mr. Kravis apparently thinks SCI TV can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until TV stations rise in value again<com> **allowing** SCI TV to sell assets to pay debt. Mr. Gillett is said to be proud of his operating record; he has lifted some stations<qu> ratings and turned around a Detroit station.

253,approve,72,The drug will be given treatment investigational new drug status<com> a label accorded to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval. The move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection.

257,approve,72,The Securities and Exchange Commission gave provisional six-month approval to the Big Board basket at a meeting late yesterday. The SEC at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the Chicago Board Options Exchange<com> where the minimum will be $1.7 million.

320,area,171,Over time<com> through benchmark surveys<com> the corrected data on service exports and imports have been gathered. The first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the U.S.. (net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad)<com> some exports by professional firms (a law firm billing a German client for services rendered in watching legislation in Washington is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine)<com> and improved data from travel and tourism. In just these three **areas**<com> the Commerce Department found $23 billion more exports than previously reported and $11.6 billion more imports<com> with the net result that the U.S. service surplus in 1988 increased by $11.3 billion<com> to $19 billion. Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade areas<com> the value of U.S. net exports that had not previously been recorded was about $20 billion a year. That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $75 billion than to $95 billion in 1988<com> and $55 billion (annualized) rather than $80 billion in the first quarter of 1989.
361,area,170,Last week<com> the government took three bills to the National Assembly. The proposed legislation is aimed at rectifying some of the inequities in the current land-ownership system.

442,area,170,The Watts mall has annual sales of more than $350 per leasable square foot; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $200. Three other Haagen shopping centers in the Watts area are doing almost as well. A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime **area** violates the more typical inner-city pattern<com> in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth<com> gangs<com> and the criminal element<com> with an erosion of the customer base<com> development capital<com> and insurability. Major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices. Along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents.
450,area,170,New approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets. If the risks and rewards are reasonable<com> developers will respond. Government officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage development in high-risk **areas** should visit Vermont-Slauson and Grand Boulevard Plaza and decide for themselves. The answer will be obvious. Mr. Titus is a researcher at the Justice Department<qu>s National Institute of Justice.
461,area,170,But many others<com> who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation<com> become tipsters for the IRS<com> says Jerry Lackey<com> who manages the IRS project<qu>s force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando.

In his **area**<com> Mr. Lackey continues<com> the miscreant employers most commonly are in construction -- doing framing<com> drywall<com> masonry and similar work.

486,area,170,A slim majority (51%) think stock prices will be higher in August 1990 than they were in August 1989. Their verdict on real estate is almost the same. Some 50% expect real estate in their local **area** to increase in value over the next 12 months. By contrast<com> only 32% expect an increase in the price of gold. Since gold tends to soar when inflation is high<com> that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control.
490,area,170,Auto insurance rates are soaring. A toxic-waste-dump fire destroyed part of an interstate highway this summer. In Monmouth<com> an important swing **area**<com> Republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county <qu>clean and green.<qu> Mr. Florio savors this vindication<com> but at age 52<com> the congressman is also a product of his times and losses.

538,area,170,State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.<com> the largest home and auto insurer in California<com> believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo.

Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement <qu>rider<qu> on a homeowner<qu>s policy in California<com> because of the **area**<qu>s vulnerability to earthquakes.

580,area,170,Crude prices spurted upward in brisk trading on the assumption that heavy earthquake damage occurred to San Francisco area refinery complexes<com> but the rise quickly fizzled when it became apparent that oil operations were n<qu>t severely curtailed. Trading on little specific information<com> market players overnight in Tokyo began bidding up oil prices. The rally spread into European markets<com> where traders were still betting that the earthquake disrupted the San Francisco **area**<qu>s large oil refining plants. By yesterday morning<com> much of the world was still unable to reach San Francisco by telephone. West Texas Intermediate was bid up more than 20 cents a barrel in many overseas markets.
591,area,170,Wall Street Journal reporters called companies with headquarters or facilities in the Bay **area** in a bid to assess the damage to their operations caused by Tuesday<qu>s earthquake.

630,ask,215,White House officials acknowledged yesterday that Democrats still are reluctant to publicly express support for the Packwood-Roth capital gains proposal because they are loath to buck Sen.

Democrats **asked** in this week for discussions with President Bush have suggested ways of <qu>tinkering<qu> with the Packwood-Roth proposal<com> suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version they can back<com> one official said. In addition<com> White House aides think that there are numerous other important measures Democrats badly wanted passed -- such as the scaling back of a controversial catastrophic health-care plan for the elderly -- that might provide the president leverage in cutting deals with Democrats. A capital-gains tax cut might be paired with such measures to help ensure passage.

2320,capital,485,That the motivation for the two-year reduction to 19.6% is budgetary does not mean it is not in the public interest. The reduction eases the burden on portfolio changes and frees capital to seek more productive or more appropriate uses. But what is really significant is the indexation of **capital** gains after 1991. To argue that this is <qu>not likely<qu> to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense. A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation<com> and the taxation of inflation-created capital gains is confiscation.

2509,capital,485,A U.S. decision to refuse the IMF its capital increase<com> or limit it to 25%<com> would bring a major change in international economic policy<com> and could not be taken lightly.

Furthermore<com> a U.S. rejection of the capital increase (and transfer of shares to Japan) would give Japan an argument against future calls for economic burden-sharing. On the other hand<com> a decision to increase the IMF<qu>s capital would reinforce the central economic role of multilateral institutions in developing countries.

That pace is causing some analysts to speculate that the Soviet Union might soon purchase as much as another two million metric tons. One sign that more Soviet purchases are possible is that U.S. grain companies yesterday bought an unusually large amount of corn **futures** contracts.

By some estimates<com> several grain companies combined bought contracts for the possession of roughly one million metric tons of corn.

Rumors of Soviet interest also pushed up the prices of soybean **futures** contracts. Among other things<com> the Agriculture Department is widely thought to be mulling whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the Soviet Union. On top of all this<com> corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the Midwest harvest was disrupted by a freakishly early snow storm that dumped several inches in parts of Indiana and Ohio.

6076,future,61,Cattle futures prices were also supported yesterday by signs that supermarket chains are making plans to increase their promotions concerning beef. GRAINS AND SOYBEANS : The prices of most soybean and soybean-meal **futures** contracts rose amid rumors that the Soviet Union is interested in buying from the U.S. or South America about 250<com>000 metric tons of soybeans and as many as 400<com>000 metric tons of soybean meal. Traders are especially sensitive to reports of possible U.S. soybean sales because U.S. exports are lagging.

The DAX index eased 0.99 **point** to end at 1523.22 after falling 5.5 points early in the session.

11033,policy,126,A face-to-face meeting with Mr. Gorbachev should damp such criticism<com> though it will hardly eliminate it. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D.<com> Maine)<com> who has been the most prominent Democratic critic of Mr. Bush<qu>s handling of the Soviet relationship<com> praised the president for arranging the meeting. But he added : <qu>The mere fact of a meeting doesn<qu>t deal with the substance of **policy**.<qu> Mr. Bush said that the December meeting<com> which was announced simultaneously in Moscow<com> will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the <qu>fanfare<qu> and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers. <qu>By doing it in this manner we can have<com> I would say<com> more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances<com> things of that nature for public consumption<com><qu> Mr. Bush said.
11057,policy,126,Exports<com> which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years<com> seem to have stalled. Factory payrolls and production fell in September<com> and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch. But Mr. Greenspan remains reluctant to loosen **policy**<com> partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional Fed banks who oppose credit easing. In addition<com> the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road. Inflation may be stable at the moment<com> running at about 4.5%.
11069,policy,126,Sir Alan considers this an ill-advised and costly policy. As there is an effort to <qu>anchor the dollar<qu> either to gold or other currencies<com> the dispute is worth examining. Until his resignation<com> Mr. Lawson had been conducting British monetary **policy** as if the pound were tied to the mark. When Mrs. Thatcher cut the top tax rate to 40%<com> Mr. Lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark. As a result<com> he reignited the inflation that Mrs. Thatcher<com> through a long and costly effort<com> had subdued.
11080,policy,126,This is a problem not only for Prime Minister Thatcher but for President Bush<com> as shown in the ongoing bickering over the dollar between the Federal Reserve and the Mulford Treasury. In the British case<com> Mr. Lawson is the closest thing in London to a supply-side globalist. He not only slashed marginal tax rates<com> initially sparking fresh growth in Britain<com> but he wanted to regulate monetary **policy** by targeting exchange rates<com> indeed joining the European Monetary System. While no doubt agreeing with Mr. Lawson on everything else<com> Sir Alan is a dyed-in-the-wool monetarist<com> inclined to defend floating rates to the death. To make matters even more confusing<com> the earlier U.S. experience made clear that Mr. Lawson<qu>s tax cuts would have profound effects on Britain<qu>s international accounts and the value of sterling.
11128,policy,126,Mr. Abalkin<com> head of the Academy of Science<qu>s Institute of Economics<com> was recently appointed deputy chairman of the Soviet government and head of a state commission on economic reform. <qu>It<qu>s clearly a manifesto for the next stage of perestroika<com><qu> said one analyst. The economic ideas in the document are much bolder than current **policies**. For example<com> the proposed overhaul of prices -- an extremely sensitive political topic -- is far more precise than the vague plans announced by Mr. Gorbachev in 1987 and later dropped. But the proposals also display political savvy<com> couching some of the most controversial ideas in cautious language so as not to alienate powerful conservatives in the government who stand to lose out if they are implemented.
11141,policy,126,The University of California at San Francisco is also circulating a memo among its scientific faculty that will restrict contact with the world of business. In many other institutions<com> scientists are shunning contacts with venture investors until the NIH policy is settled.

11163,policy,126,Over the summer<com> Anheuser competitors offered more and deeper discounts than industry observers have seen for a long time. Some experts now predict Anheuser<qu>s entry into the fray means near-term earnings trouble for all the industry players. The St. Louis company said major rivals<com> Philip Morris Co.<qu>s Miller Brewing unit and Adolph Coors Co. <qu>have been following a **policy** of continuous and deep discounting for at least the past 18 months<qu> on their premium brands<com> pricing their product as much as 25 cents a 12-pack below Anheuser<qu>s Budweiser label in many markets. Anheuser said it<qu>s discounting policy basically would involve matching such moves by rivals on a market-by-market basis. Anheuser-Busch announced its plan at the same time it reported third-quarter net income rose a lower-than-anticipated 5.2% to $238.3 million<com> or 83 cents a share<com> from $226.5 million<com> or 78 cents.
11216,policy,127,<qu>It needs more discipline.

Some 1<com>750 members quit the exchange last year<com> more than triple the number of resignations in 1987. Names are resigning at an even faster pace this year.
11249,policy,127,Even if you<qu>re healthy and can renew<com> your premium will go up sharply because you<qu>re that much older. So term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks. There are all sorts of variations on term insurance : **policies** structured to pay off your mortgage debt<com> term riders tacked on to permanent insurance<com> and many others. One variation that appealed to me at first was the <qu>Money Smart Term Life<qu> policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co.<com> the American Express unit<com> to the parent company<qu>s credit-card holders. Upon examination<com> however<com> I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense.
11311,policy,126,At least<com> it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a 10-fold increase in the money supply during the same period. And that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the Federal Reserve. The basic problem of monetary **policy**<com> to which reform of the Fed should be addressed<com> is to prevent a recurrence of this experience. There were two general reasons for the mistaken monetary policy of the past 30 years : 1. To some extent the Federal Reserve shared the popular but incorrect view that expansionary monetary policy could yield a net improvement in employment and output.

11485,position,306,The U.S. government<qu>s Sverdlovsk complaint<com> as with Krasnoyarsk<com> is no mere political posturing. Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate<com> and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the U.S. government. But the stated U.S. **position** is detailed and specific<com> and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling. The Soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that Sverdlovsk violated the 1972 agreement or<com> alternatively<com> that would give U.S. specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident. Until that happens<com> glasnost can not begin to deserve the kind of credibility Mr. Shevardnadze was bidding for with his confessions on Monday.

He won D.T.<qu>s queen for two minor pieces and two pawns -- not enough compensation<com> in this **position**<com> to give the computer much hope. In a hopeless position<com> the computer resigned rather than make its 37th move. And Mr. Kasparov<com> to cheers and applause<com> marched back into the analysis room.
11517,position,309,Randolph W. McElroy<com> a vice chairman of this bank-holding company<com> was named to the additional **position** of chairman of its principal unit<com> Sovran Bank.

11521,position,307,General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France. <qu>We found the market not developing as we thought it would<com><qu> a GE spokesman says. The small U.S. firms are persisting because of their strong **positions** in patents<com> and because the prize is still there to be seized. <qu>No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels<qu> at commercial costs<com> says Zvi Yaniv<com> the president of Ovonic Imaging. He says he thinks his company is just a few years from doing that.
11528,position,306,<qu>We made our own decision<com><qu> he said. Still<com> Mr. Utsumi may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in orchestrating recent moves by Japanese banks. All week there has been much speculation in financial circles in Tokyo and abroad about the ministry<qu>s real **position**.

11648,power,352,Some analysts estimate the average PC costs about 50% more in Japan than the U.S.. But the complex language is n<qu>t the only reason. For the past decade<com> NEC Corp. has owned more than half the Japanese PC market and ruled it with near-monopoly **power**. With little competition<com> the computer industry here is inefficient.

11660,power,354,Already this year<com> it has received orders for four 150-megawatt advanced combustion turbines from Florida Power & Light Co. and for two 300-megawatt plants from Intercontinental Energy Corp.<com> among others. Westinghouse<qu>s own role as a supplier also is changing. In the past<com> the company usually took token equity positions in **power** plants it supplied as a <qu>kicker<qu> to close deals. But last June<qu>s annnouncement that Westinghouse would put up all of the $70 million to build a new 55-megawatt plant could herald a new age. Westinghouse<qu>s plant will provide electrical power to the Southern California Edison Co. and backup power and steam to the U.S. Borax & Chemical Co.
11693,power,353,But in 1989 most senators have other ideas. Last July<com> his committee rejected a Reagan administration plan to support a coup in Panama. Ohio Democrat Howard Metzenbaum refused to support any plan that might get people hurt<com> a charming notion for a great **power**. Maine Republican William Cohen said the plan might violate the assassination ban. So the administration dropped it.

11729,power,354,Robert L. Wood<com> 37-year-old chief financial officer<com> was named chairman and chief executive officer of this independent **power** producer<com> succeeding Raymond L. Hixson<com> 63. Mr. Hixson<com> who resigned effective Jan. 1 for health reasons<com> remains a director.
11733,power,352,THE HOUSE FAILED to override Bush<qu>s veto of a bill easing abortion funding. The chamber voted 231-191<com> 51 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to overturn the president<qu>s veto of legislation renewing support of Medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest. The roll call was considered an illustration of the limits of **power** that the resurgent abortion-rights movement faces. The legislation was part of a $156.7 billion measure funding the departments of Labor<com> Education<com> and Health. Michigan<qu>s Senate passed a bill requiring girls to get parental consent for an abortion and Pennsylvania<qu>s House cleared a measure banning abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy.
11758,power,354,Consumers Power Co. filed with the Michigan Public Service Commission a contract to buy **power** from the Palisades nuclear plant under a proposed new ownership arrangement for the plant.

11793,power,352,When market tremors start<com> it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve (buy and sell orders at various prices) be made available to all<com> not just to market makers. Because of a lack of information and access<com> many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed<com> because of their ignorance of important market information. To add aftershock-damping **power** to America<qu>s markets<com> a modern<com> electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena (and the information that would automatically accompany such access) by investors -- particularly institutional investors. Contrary to some opinions<com> the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole. What market makers provide is immediacy<com> a very valuable service.
11841,power,352,Leveraged buy-outs may be curbed by two rules in pending congressional legislation. The provisions<com> in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate<com> could raise the price tags of such deals by up to 10% and cool the takeover boom. A bill giving the Transportation Department the **power** to block airline leveraged buy-outs cleared a House panel. But Secretary Skinner said he would urge Bush to veto the bill. Housing starts sank 5.2% in September to a seven-year low.
11844,power,352,The 77-year-old official<com> who oversaw the building of the Berlin Wall<com> was removed during a meeting of the 163-member Communist Party Central Committee in East Berlin.

He was succeeded by internal-security chief Egon Krenz<com> 52<com> a hard-liner who quickly ruled out any sharing of **power** with pro-democracy groups.

BNL previously reported that its Georgia branch had taken on loan commitments topping $3 billion without the Rome-based management<qu>s approval.

11949,president,281,As a result<com> Judge John F. Keenan of New York ordered Mrs. Marcos to turn over to the court all pleadings and documents she may have filed in foreign countries in opposition to U.S. requests for evidence. Mrs. Marcos had claimed that she did n<qu>t have to turn over the documents because she was brought here involuntarily and because providing the materials would violate her marital privilege. In 1988<com> a year and a half after Mrs. Marcos and her late husband<com> Ferdinand Marcos<com> the ousted **president** of the Philippines<com> fled the Philippines for Hawaii<com> they were charged with racketeering<com> conspiracy<com> obstruction of justice and mail fraud in a scheme in which they allegedly embezzled more than $100 million from their homeland.

12058,president,282,The White House used television appearances and leaks to argue that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made U.S. support for such coups difficult. Mr. Bush even disclosed privately that one Reagan-era deal with Congress required him to notify the odious Panamanian dictator<com> Manuel Noriega<com> if the U.S. learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life. The **president** also hinted he might veto this year<qu>s intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive. Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren (D.<com> Okla.) and Vice Chairman William Cohen (R.<com> Maine)<com> for their part<com> angrily accused the White House of selectively leaking classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to Congress for the bungled attempt to topple Gen.

Cineplex traded on the New York Stock Exchange at $11.25 a share<com> up $1.125<com> before trading was halted.

Computer Associates closed at $13.625<com> down 25 cents<com> in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Anthony Wang<com> **president**<com> attributed the drop to the disruption of the company<qu>s business resulting from the prolonged process of acquiring Cullinet.

The **president**<qu>s request did n<qu>t indicate how Mr. Cheney would shift the money.

12492,president,282,Gen. Scowcroft was a member of the Tower Commission<com> which investigated the Iran-Contra affair.

Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely<com> gathering the views of the State Department<com> Pentagon and intelligence community; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the **president** and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out. The Tower Commission specifically said that the NSC staff should be <qu>small<qu> and warned against letting <qu>energetic self-starters<qu> like Lt. Col. Oliver North strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the State Department<com> Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency.

12545,president,282,No notification was ever considered<com> officials said<com> apparently because the U.S. did n<qu>t think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega<com> but merely sought to imprison him. What<qu>s more<com> both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House. The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12<com> a few days before the meeting at which the **president** complained about the rules. However<com> the disclosure of the guidelines<com> first reported last night by NBC News<com> is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress.
